# fp-stuff-in-js
My implementations of common functions and data structures from functional programming using pure Javascript

Repo created with the purpose of studying functional programming using only Javascript. In this first moment it will be focused on implementing common FP data types and the functions to satisfy the categories in which they belong (Monad, Functors, Monoids, among others). Every instance of a category will be proven using its laws.

In the current moment, the data types Identity, Maybe and Either are implemented with their respective instances of Monad.

The next steps are the implementations of Functor, Applicative and Monoid categories to each of these three data types.
